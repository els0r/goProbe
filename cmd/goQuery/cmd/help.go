  COLUMNS

    A comma separated list of columns over which to perform the "GROUP BY"/drilldown.
    Available columns:

      sip   (or src)   source ip
      dip   (or dst)   destination ip
      dport (or port)  destination port
      proto            protocol (e.g. UDP, TCP)

      hostname         hostname
      iface            interface
      time             timestamp

  QUERY_TYPE

    Type of query to perform (top talkers or top applications). This allows you to
    conveniently specify commonly used column combinations.

      talk_src        top talkers by source IP (default)
                      (equivalent to columns "sip")
      talk_dst        top talkers by destination IP
                      (equivalent to columns "dip")
      talk_conv       top talkers by IP pairs ("conversation")
                      (equivalent to columns "sip,dip")
      apps_port       top applications by protocol:[port]
                      (equivalent to columns "dport,proto")
      agg_talk_port   aggregation of conversation and applications
                      (equivalent to columns "sip,dip,dport,proto")
      raw             a raw dump of all flows, including timestamps and interfaces
                      (equivalent to columns "time,iface,sip,dip,dport,proto")
`

var helpMap = map[string]string{
	"Ifaces": `Interfaces for which the query should be performed
(e.g. "eth0 "eth0,t4_33760").
You can specify "ANY" to query all interfaces.
`,
	"Help": `Display this help text.
`,
	"Help-admin": `Display advanced options for database maintenance.

	"First": `Upper/lower bound on flow timestamp

DEFAULTS

  --first will default to the last 30 days if not provided. In case
  a "time" attribute is involved (e.g. for "time" or "raw" queries),
  the default is lowered to the last 24 hours. This is to protect
  against accidentally querying the entire database.

  --last will default to the current time if not provided

  -15d:04h:05m                          RELATIVE
  -15d4h5m

Relative time will be evaluated with respect to NOW. The call can
be varied to include any (integer) combination of days (d), hours
(h) and minutes (m), e.g.

  -15d:04h:05m, -15d:5m, -15d, -5m, -4h, -4h:05m, etc.

NOTE: there is no attribute for "month" as it collides with "m"
      used for minutes. If you plan to run queries over a time
      span of several months, simply specify the number of days
      that should be taken into account (e.g. "-45d").

TIME ZONES:

      All CUSTOM time formats support an offset from UTC. It can be
      used to evaluate dates in timezones different from the one used
      on the host (e.g. Europe/Zurich - CEST). The format is {+,-}0000.
      For a host in San Fransisco (PDT), a difference of -7 hours to
      UTC is given. The date would be passed as

        02.01.06 -0700

      In Sydney time (AEST), the same date would be passed as

        02.01.06 +1000

      while in Tehran (IRDT) it would be written as

        02.01.06 +0430
`,
	"Condition": `The conditional consists of multiple conditions chained together
via logical operators. The condition precedence is set via bracing of
individual condition chains.

A single condition consists of an attribute, a comparative operator,
and a value against which the attribute is checked, e.g.:

    dport <= 1024

ATTRIBUTES:

  Talker:

    dip (or dst)       Destination IP/Hostname
    sip (or src)       Source IP/Hostname
    host               Source IP/Hostname or Destination IP/Hostname

    EXAMPLE: "dip != 192.168.1.34 & sip = 172.16.22.15" is equivalent to
             "src != 192.168.1.34 & dst = 172.16.22.15"
             "host = 192.168.1.34" is equivalent to
             "(sip = 192.168.1.34 | dip = 192.168.1.34)"
             "host != 192.168.1.34" is equivalent to
             "(sip != 192.168.1.34 & dip != 192.168.1.34)"
             "sip = foo.com" is equivalent to
             "sip = 2a00:50::1009 | sip = 173.194.116.40"
             (assuming that those are the A and AAAA records of foo.com)

  Talker by network:

    dnet        Destination network in CIDR notation
    snet        Source network in CIDR notation
    net         Source network or destination network

    EXAMPLE: "dnet = 192.168.1.0/25 | snet = 172.16.22.0/12"
             "net = 192.168.1.0/24" is equivalent to
             "(snet = 192.168.1.0/24 | dnet = 192.168.1.0/24)"
             "net != 192.168.1.0/24" is equivalent to
             "(snet != 192.168.1.0/24 & dnet != 192.168.1.0/24)"

  Application:

    dport (or port) Destination port
    proto           IP protocol

    EXAMPLE: "dport = 22 & proto = TCP" is equivalent to
             "port = 22 & proto = 6"

  Traffic Direction:

    direction (or dir)   Direction filter to match against aggregated results

    USAGE:
      dir = {in|inbound}:         incoming but no outgoing packets
      dir = {out|outbound}:       outgoing but no incoming packets
      dir = {uni|unidirectional}: either only incoming or only outgoing packets
      dir = {bi|bidirectional}:   both incoming and outgoing packets (no unidir. traffic)

    NOTE:
      dir may only appear as (1) a top-level condition,
      or (2) a condition of a top-level AND (&)

    EXAMPLE:
      dir = uni
      dir = in & sip = 192.168.1.34
      (dport = 22 & sip = 192.168.1.34) & dir = out

COMPARATIVE OPERATORS:

  Base    Description            Other representations

     =    equal to               eq, -eq, equals, ==, ===
    !=    not equal to           neq, -neq, ne, -ne
    <=    less or equal to       le, -le, leq, -leq
    >=    greater or equal to    ge, -ge, geq, -geq
     <    less than              less, l, -l, lt, -lt
     >    greater than           greater, g, -g, gt, -gt

All of the items under "Other representations" (except for "===" and
"==") must be enclosed by whitespace.

  NOTE: In case the attribute involves an IP address, only "=" and "!="
        are supported.

Individual conditions can be chained together via logical operators,
e.g.

    ! dport = 8080 | dport = 443 & proto = TCP

LOGICAL OPERATORS:

  Base    Description            Other representations

     !    unary negation         not
     &    and                    and, &&, *
     |    or                     or, ||, +

The representations "not", and", and "or" require enclosing whitespace.

PRECEDENCE:

In terms of logical operator precendence, NOT is evaluated before AND
and AND is evaluated before OR.

Thus above expression would be evaluated as

    (! dport = 8080) | ( dport = 443 & proto = TCP)

Precedence can be enforced by bracing condition chains appropriately,
e.g.

    ! (( dport = 8080 | dport = 443 ) & proto = TCP )

NOT simply negates whatever comes after it. For example

    (! dport = 8080) | (! (dport = 443 & proto = TCP))

is equivalent to

    dport != 8080 | (dport != 443 | proto != TCP)).

The braces "[]" and "{}" can also be used.

SYNTAX

The condition can be expressed in different syntaxes, which can be
combined arbitrarily to the user's liking. Consider the following
conditional:

    ( proto = TCP & snet != 192.168.0.0/16 )
  & ( dport <= 1024 | dport >= 443 )

It can also be provided as:

    ( proto eq  TCP and snet neq 1.2.0.0/16 )
and ( dport   le 1024 or dport   ge 443 )

    [ proto  =  TCP   * snet  != 1.2.0.0/16 ]
  * [ dport   <= 1024  + dport   >= 443 ]

    { proto -eq TCP  && snet -ne 1.2.0.0/16 }
  * { dport -leq 1024 || dport -geq 443 }

and any other combination of the allowed representations.
